[Drawing with Code](http://carolinerecord.com/hci/drawingWithCode.html) is intended to expose participants to how to be creative with code. 
There are a bunch of fun examples to play with! There is everything from moving a puppet around with your face to drawings that dance around when you scream at them.

- the flocking example is based on [this code](https://processing.org/examples/flocking.html) by Daniel Shiffman
- the face puppet example is based on [this code](https://github.com/CreativeInquiry/FaceOSC-Templates/blob/master/processing/FaceOSCReceiver/FaceOSCReceiver.pde) by Dan Wilcox

You can download all these examples by going to "github.com/CMP-Studio/Hour_Of_Code_Curriculum/" and pressing the "Download Zip" button on the right on this web page. You will also need Processing, which you can [download](https://processing.org/download/) at processing.org/download/.

If you are just learning how to program, I strongly recommend checking out [Scratch!](https://scratch.mit.edu/)scratch.mit.edu

## Coding Challenges

### Getting Started

1. What is your favorite color? "tweak" the colors in crazy waves (01_Positions/crazyWaves) till it's your favorite color.

2. Tweak the variables in crazy waves (01_Positions/crazyWaves) till you like the way it look, save a picture, and print it out!

3. Do the same for the smiley example (01_Positions/smiley).
4. Break something in the smiley example and try to figure out why! 
5. Look a the tree grow example (03_Science/treeGrow). Try whistling at it and see what happens. Try changing the color of the tree using tweak mode.
5. "Comment" and "uncomment" something in the code. What does it change? 

### Going Deeper

1. What is the smiley example (01_Positions/smiley) missing? Freckles? Ears? ... Use simple shapes from the [processing reference] (https://processing.org/reference/) to add a new feature. 

2. Look at the smileyGenerator example (02_Randomness/smileyGenerator). Try changing it so it only produces smilies with various shades of red faces. 

3. Explore the birds example (03_Science/birds). Try tweeking the behavior and the color of the flock.
